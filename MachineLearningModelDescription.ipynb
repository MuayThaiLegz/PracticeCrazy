Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network.

Neurons are organized into layers, with an input layer for receiving the input data, one or more hidden layers for intermediate processing, and an output layer for producing the final predictions or outputs. Training a Neural Network involves a process called forward propagation, where the input data is fed into the network, and the signals pass through the layers, undergoing weighted transformations and activations. The weights and biases associated with each neuron are adjusted iteratively during training using an optimization algorithm, such as gradient descent, to minimize the difference between the predicted outputs and the true labels or target values.

In the case of classification, KNN assigns the majority class label among its K nearest neighbors to the new data point. The value of K is a hyperparameter that determines the number of neighbors considered. A larger K value leads to a smoother decision boundary but may increase the risk of misclassification.

        "        'Unlike a single tree, results from a random forest cannot be displayed in a tree-like diagram, thereby losing the interpretability that a single tree provides. However, random forests can produce “variable importance” scores, which measure the relative contribution of the different predictors. The importance score for a particular predictor is computed by summing up the decrease in the Gini index for that predictor over all the trees in the forest.',\n",
        "        'Tree methods are good off-the-shelf classifiers and predictors. They are also useful for variable selection, with the most important predictors usually showing up at the top of the tree. Trees require relatively little effort from users in the following senses: First, there is no need for transformation of variables (any monotone transformation of the variables will give the same trees). Second, variable subset selection is automatic since it is part of the split selection.']}\n",
